    "Regularization helps control the variance of a model by reducing its sensitivity to the specific training examples or noise in the data. By preventing the model from overfitting the training data, regularization limits the variability in the model's predictions when exposed to different datasets. Models with high variance tend to be more sensitive to small changes in the training data and may exhibit erratic behavior or overfitting. Regularization mitigates this by discouraging the model from becoming overly complex and dependent on specific examples.\n",
